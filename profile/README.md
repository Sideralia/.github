_A project, software, and wiki by astronomers, for astronomers_

## Â¿What is Sideralia?
Originally it became a concept of teaching 101 concepts of astronomy but the idea quickly grew to become something much
bigger. Thus, the project contemplates the publication of a book and currently there is a Astronomy Wiki running!
